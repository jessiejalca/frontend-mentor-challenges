## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- **How to handle subheadings:** Using next-level heading tags (like `<h2>` after `<h1>`) for subheadings is semantically incorrect and can cause issues. It's best to use a paragraph element with a "subhead" class. It's also important to note that "subheadings" are actually different from "subtitles" or "taglines." The best term to use here is generally "subhead."

```html
<h1>Example Header</h1>
<p class="subhead">Example subhead</p>
```

- **Adding screen-reader only information:**

### Continued development

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Semantic Subheadings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3910419/semantic-structure-in-html-subtitles-pre-html5) - This Stack Overflow question helped me understand the semantics behind subheadings a little bit better, and I developed my own preference based on the answers.
